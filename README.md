To make this code run correctly copy the code below into a notebook;

    !git clone https://github.com/orlaithnidhuill-ucd/hst-hrd-assignment.git

Once successfully cloned run;

    run /content/hst-hrd-assignment/your-code.py

It should look something like this

Note for transparency and academic integrity, I include the following statement regarding the external non-UCD assistance used;
I used AI (ChatGPT), and StackOverflow for a fair bit of debugging (clarifying errors, making some inprovements and trying to better user portability). That said pretty much all of the algorithmic choices, parameters, and code logic follow the Brightspace course notebooks, so I think this work overall would be my own and plagarism was avoided where possible.
