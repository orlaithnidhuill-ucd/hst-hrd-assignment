To make this code run correctly copy the code below into a notebook;

    !git clone https://github.com/orlaithnidhuill-ucd/hst-hrd-assignment.git

Once successfully cloned run;

    run /content/hst-hrd-assignment/your-code.py

It should look something like this

In the spirit of transparency and academic integrity, I include the following statement regarding the external non-UCD assistance used;
I used AI (ChatGPT), and StackOverflow for a fair bit of debugging (clarifying errors, making some improvemnets and user portability). That said pretty much all of the algorithmic choices, parameters, and code logic follow the Brightspace course notebooks, so I think this work overall would qualify as my own and plagarism was avoided where possible.
